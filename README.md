	To have a look at our project kindly open the "index.html" file. Spot me! is a game which tests the ability of a person. Once the game is loaded, you can see that there are two screens divided. One is for the menu and another for the game screen.

	In menu there are 
	1. Play:
		Once this button is clicked, an alert is poped, then the game starts. This button will no longer be available after starting the play.
	2. Reset:
		This button is to reload the game, irrespective of the current state.
	3. ScoreBoard:
		Here, the score is displayed. Initial score will be '0' (zero) and as we go on pass the levels one by one the score increases by '5' (Five) each time. 

How to play:

	Once the game starts, the smileys will be displayed on the page. One in the menu, and others in the game screen. The smiley, which is displayed in the menu is the one which need to be spotted in the game screen. Once we click on the correct smiley, you will be going to next level. Each level increases the number of smileys present in the game screen.
	There is time limit of 10 secound for each level in which you need to click on the correct smiley. If you haven't clicked the correct smiley or in the timelimit, there will be a gameover and your score will be poped as an alert.
